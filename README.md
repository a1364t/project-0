# TicTacToe (Project-0)
TicTacToe is the first project in software engineering immersive course in General Assembly. In this project, a TicTacToe game was designed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

## Usage
If two players want to play, each player can either enter their name or their desired token and start playing. Tokens should be a letter. If no name or token is selected, `Player 1` and `Player 2` will be chosen as default player names and `X` and `O` goes for each player, respectively. The scoreboard shows  how many times each player win the game.
In the single-player version, the player can pick a name and token, however, it would be `Player 1` and `X` by default. 

# Challenges
* Making an array with a length of 9 that fills with `X` or `O` comparing the elements of the array every time to find the winner.
* Designing a modal in Javascripts that announce the name of the winner with a button to reset the game.
* Designing the game for a single player. Generate a random number between 0 and 8 every time that the user clicks and put it in empty elements inside the array using a while loop.
* Design a winningArray which include all winning patterns and compare the results with all patterns every time that users click.

# To be implemented
In future, the following features will be implemented.

* Using player images instead of letters as a token.
* Make the single-player version more difficult for the user to win the game.

# Bugs/Issues
* In the single-player version, the computer goes one step further when the player wins the game.
